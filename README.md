##Getting Started

  You will be needing the following tools,
  
  * Chrome Browser - To render the output
  * Sublime Text 3

## How to build a page like this - [Click Here](http://vinodhthiagarajan1309.github.io/)

  * For creating HTML you will be needing snippets which will be taking slice of time , so this site. I decided to work
  Bootstrap CSS framework for this project. Try out this page [http://www.initializr.com/](http://www.initializr.com/).

  * Another site I used is [shoelace.io](shoelace.io). You should understand the concepts of grids before you use this site. 
  First read about it in [http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid) from the bootstarp page itself. Since bootstrap is mobile
  first , I choose the mobile to define my layout and then work on the other displays. Remember one fact " A row has 12 sections".
  Once you have decided how you want your layout you can generate it. Since we are building a HTML page you can use the HTML code from this screen.
